# ‚úÖ Implementation Checklist

## Immediate Next Steps (Do This Now!)

### 1. Verify Code Compilation
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] All imports resolved
- [x] All new files created

### 2. Firebase Console Setup (5 minutes)
- [ ] Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
- [ ] Create `users` collection (if doesn't exist)
- [ ] Add your user document:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "your-firebase-auth-email@example.com",
    "phone": "+919876543210",
    "role": "supervisor",
    "teamId": "team001",
    "areaCode": "EKM-04",
    "bonusPoints": 0,
    "bonusAmount": 0,
    "createdAt": [current timestamp]
  }
  ```
- [ ] Create `teams` collection
- [ ] Add team document (ID: team001):
  ```json
  {
    "supervisorId": "[your-user-document-id]",
    "managerId": null,
    "areaCode": "EKM-04",
    "members": ["[your-user-document-id]"],
    "assets": [],
    "createdAt": [current timestamp]
  }
  ```

### 3. Test Basic Functionality
- [ ] Hot reload/restart the app
- [ ] Login with Firebase Auth
- [ ] Check Worker Home screen loads
- [ ] **Verify Staff Management card is now visible** ‚ú®
- [ ] Tap Staff Management
- [ ] Tap "+ Add Staff" button
- [ ] Fill in staff details (unique phone/email)
- [ ] Submit and verify staff appears in list
- [ ] Verify staff document created in Firestore

### 4. Verify Data in Firestore
- [ ] Check `users` collection has new staff with:
  - `role: "staff"`
  - `teamId: "team001"` (your team)
  - Correct name, phone, email
- [ ] Verify your supervisor user exists
- [ ] Verify team document has correct members array

## Short-term Tasks (This Week)

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Read [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for quick tips
- [ ] Review [DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md](DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md) for schema
- [ ] Check [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions

### Security Rules
- [ ] Review [firestore.rules.new](firestore.rules.new)
- [ ] Test rules in Firebase Emulator (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Deploy rules to production:
  ```bash
  # Backup current rules first!
  firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
  ```

### Data Migration (If You Have Existing Data)
- [ ] Backup all Firestore data
- [ ] Review [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Test migration scripts on development database
- [ ] Run migration scripts on production
- [ ] Verify data integrity
- [ ] Test all features with migrated data

### Extended Testing
- [ ] Test with multiple user roles (staff, supervisor, manager)
- [ ] Test staff CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Test on physical device
- [ ] Test offline behavior
- [ ] Test with slow network

---

## Medium-term Tasks (This Month)

- [ ] Update `attendance_screen.dart` to use flat `attendance` collection
- [ ] Update `attendance_history_screen.dart`
- [ ] Create `AttendanceService` for business logic
- [ ] Migrate existing attendance data
- [ ] Test attendance check-in/out

### Worksheet Enhancements
- [ ] Update worksheet screen to use team structure
- [ ] Add material tracking to worksheets
- [ ] Implement geotagging
- [ ] Add photo upload for work documentation
- [ ] Link worksheets to attendance

### New Features Implementation

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Database structure designed
- [x] Models created (UserModel, TeamModel, AttendanceModel)
- [x] Services created (UserService, TeamService, updated StaffService)
- [x] Staff Management UI updated
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Documentation complete

### ‚è≥ In Progress (Requires Manual Setup)
- [ ] Test user added to Firebase
- [ ] Team created in Firebase
- [ ] Staff Management tested and working

### üìã Planned (Future Work)
- [ ] Attendance system migrated
- [ ] All existing data migrated
- [ ] New features implemented

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attendance system still uses old structure (workers/{uid}/attendance)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Existing data not migrated yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Security rules not deployed yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some screens (worksheet, materials) not updated to team structure

### Workarounds
- ‚úÖ Staff Management works with new structure
- ‚úÖ Can add/edit/delete staff using new system
- ‚úÖ Can test with new users without migrating old data
- ‚úÖ Old features still work (attendance, worksheets)

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Code Rollback**
   ```bash
   git revert [commit-hash]
   ```

2. **Data Rollback**
   - Restore from backup
   - Old collections are untouched (worker_info, staff_details)

3. **Rules Rollback**
   - Deploy old rules from backup
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

4. **Switch Logic**
   - Update code to use old collections
   - Revert service imports in screens

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for initial testing  
**Next Step:** Add test user to Firebase Console
