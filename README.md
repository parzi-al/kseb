## 🔄 Migration

If you have existing data in the old structure (`worker_info`, `staff_details`):

1. **Backup your data** first!
2. Follow [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
3. Run migration scripts in Firebase Console
4. Verify data integrity
5. Deploy new security rules

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Staff Management Not Visible
**Cause:** User doesn't have proper role or teamId  
**Fix:** See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) - Add user to `users` collection

### Permission Denied
**Cause:** Firestore security rules not deployed  
**Fix:** Deploy `firestore.rules.new` to your Firebase project

### Cannot Add Staff
**Cause:** Duplicate phone/email or invalid teamId  
**Fix:** Ensure phone/email are unique, teamId exists in teams collection

See [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for more troubleshooting tips.
